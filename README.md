# Weather History App

The Weather History App is designed for users who want to download and store historical weather data for a foreign country. It provides functionality to retrieve weather information using a free weather API, input specific dates and years, and display maximum and minimum temperatures for those dates. Additionally, the app allows users to store weather data locally using *ROOM database*, ensuring access even without an internet connection.
